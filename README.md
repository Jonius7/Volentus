<h2 align="center">Volentus Modpack</h2>
<h4 align="center">The kitchen sink and all the add-ons</h4>



This will be a **Minecraft 1.7.10** modpack that contains all the main mods, but plenty of other mods that get left out in modpacks. (378 mods)



You have as many options as possible from all the **tech mods** and their add-ons (short of overhaul mods), a good amount of **magic mods** + **add-ons** both well and lesser known.



This pack has been through a number of revisions since 2018, as such, worlds may break with some versions. But things should be settled down now with this many mods.



While the pack works (with some minor issues), it is quite demanding. Recommended **6.5GB - 7GB RAM** for this modpack.



There is an Excel Spreadsheet `mod-list.xlsx` listing all the mods and what type of mod they are, it can be easy to lose track otherwise.



Some mods have been personally modified or bugfixed by yours truly.

Aim is to release the modpack on CurseForge (and maybe Technic), but there is a lot of work to do before doing so.
