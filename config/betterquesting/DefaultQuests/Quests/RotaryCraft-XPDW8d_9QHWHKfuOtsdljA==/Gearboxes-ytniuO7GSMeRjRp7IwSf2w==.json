      "desc:8": "In the previous quest, you crafted a §6Wooden 2:1 Gearbox§r in order for the §8DC Electric Engine§r to power the pump. You will need plenty of Gearboxes in the future to convert differing values of §2Torque (Nm)§r and §cSpeed (rad/s)§r.\n\nIt so happens that §6Wooden Gearboxes§r work out of the box, but have a low Torque and Speed capacity §2§5(278 Nm at 3577 rad/s)§r. If it is given shaft power exceeding either of these values the gearbox will break and explode.\n\nSo you will need to construct Gearboxes out of a sturdier material (Stone, HSLA Steel, Diamond etc). These higher tier Gearboxes however require §eLubricant§r to function properly or they will §4become damaged§r as they operate.\n- §5Stone to Tungsten Gearboxes§r require constant §eLubricant§r as they operate.\n- §bDiamond Gearboxes§r can take 1 bucket worth of §eLubricant§r but will not consume it\n- §8Bedrock Gearboxes§r do not need §eLubricant§r at all\n\nYou can repair §4damaged§r gearboxes by §3right-clicking§r them with §6gears§r of the corresponding material.\n\nGearboxes can be changed between §2Torque mode§r and §cSpeed mode§r by §3Shift + Right§r clicking the gearbox.",
